# Week 5

Time spent on the project: 13 hours

## Week 5 progress 

### Course progress

* Algorithms and data structures ready (but may still be adjusted). 

### Project progress

* Remove dijkstra from river generation and insted use a simpler and faster (but not as natural-looking) algorithm to generate both rivers and lakes
* Implement binary heap, node, random number generation and math functions
* Replace most imports with own implementations
* More tests

## New things learned


## Questions and problems


## Next week

* Improve roughen method and biome selection for more natural looking maps
* Add some randomization to river generation so that it does not always pick neighbors in the same order if there are several with same weight
* Improve code quality
* Add tests if needed
* Finish documentation
* If time: improve UI (make it nicer, add buttons for showing height and moisture maps and possibly other functions). Try to make the maps look good on all sizes (now they look best when map size exponent is 9 and multiplier 1).

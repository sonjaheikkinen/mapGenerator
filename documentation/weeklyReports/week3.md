# Week 2

Time spent on the project: 13 hours

## Week 2 progress

### Course progress

### Project progress

* Removed edge wrapping
* Moisture generation with diamond square
* Biomes based on height and moisture
* Biome colors
* Jitter/noise on height and moisture maps for more natural look

## New things learned

## Questions and problems

* When using map exponents greater than 9, the program takes too long (about a minute or more) to 
get started. After initial start, new maps are still generated rather quickly so this is not too much of a problem, but I would still like to find a way to make it a bit faster.

## Next week

* Create rivers and lakes based on humidity (less water to dry areas)
* Make a better roughen method for more natural looking noise maps (maybe separate methods for heights and humidity?)
* Make research concerning cities and roads
* Slider or selection for water level if time
* If time, adjust biome colors and borders for more natural looking maps + draw height lines
or basic lighting to show height differences

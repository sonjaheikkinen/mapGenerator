# Week 1 

Time spent on the project: 15 hours. Only two of those went for the actual project, rest were used on background research and testing.

## Week 1 progress

Most of this week I spent on choosing what kind of project should I make. First I wanted to make a program that would let me sketch a map 
(water, land, mountains and biggest cities) and would then simulate natural phenomena and generate biomes, lakes, rivers and roads accordingly. 
But that would not have been a good project, since I would have to make a sketching tool for it which would take time from the actual algorithm. After that
I tought of making a dungeon generator, but there were too many algorithms and approaches to choose from, so I settled into a simpler procedural map generator 
without the sketching functionality (though I may implement it later if time allows).

### Course progress

* Project creation
* Project definition document
* Issues
* Labtool

### Project progress

* Creation
* Added javaFX plugin to build.gradle for Graphic UI

## New things learned

I have read tons of information about different kind of grids and algorithms common in indie game development. I learned to do a simple random walk and 
a Diamond-square algorithm to test out how to create dungeons and maps, which was fun. I am also really interested in implementing a Voronoi diagram with 
Lloyd relaxation based "grid" for my maps, since I learned that this approach provides a more natural look than a basic grid, but I think that might take 
too much time.

## Questions and problems

* I am still quite unsure on which algorithms I should use in river and road generation, but I will search for those when it is time to implement them.
* I am currently planning on making algorithms for terrain height, water placement, biome selection and possibly cities and roads. It is hard to say how much 
time this will take since I have never done anything like this before (except for the actual drawing of the map with java). Will this be a good amount of 
work or should I add or remove something? 
* Should these weekly reports be more essay-like or is it okay to use bullet points? 

## Next week

* Generate height map and ocean
* Get started on lakes and rivers
* Make research concerning cities and roads

# Week 6

Time spent on the project: 15 hours

## Week 6 progress 

I attempted to make the project as ready as I could this week, since next week I probably won't have much time for it. I did not have time to make all the adjustments to the UI that I wanted (there is no option for saving maps), but it still turned out ok. I also did not have time to optimize the river generation for different map sizes, so it only looks good with map size exponent of 9, but I guess the amount of rivers is not the most important thing to learn in this course. 

### Course progress

* Project ready
* Documentation almost ready (installation guide missing)

### Project progress

* Adjust colors of the map
* Improve UI (it can now show height and moisture maps and the placement of biomes). 
* Refactor code
* Replace math imports with own math functions.
* Tried to replace random number generation with my own implementation, but it did not work correctly so I gave up with that. The code for the random number generator can still be found within the project.
